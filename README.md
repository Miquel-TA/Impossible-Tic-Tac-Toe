# Impossible Tic Tac Toe

This Python script uses the tkinter module to implement a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent.
The AI is designed using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to select moves, so it's pretty much impossible to beat.

## Features

- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine AI moves.
- Simple graphical interface using tkinter for gameplay.
- Detection of game end conditions like wins or draws.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Python:**
